# Superstore-Sales-Forecasting
Performed exploratory data analysis on a super store’s data to gain useful insights about the store’s sales. Visualization tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly were used to display the information obtained by Performing EDA. Trained a time series analysis model, SARIMA using the pre-processed data to predict the future sales of the store.
